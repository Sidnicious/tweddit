# Tweddit

A [Hacker School](http://www.hackerschool.com/) project

## It’s like the front page of some news aggregation website but everyone’s already voting

Tweddit listens to a real-time stream of posts from Twitter ([about 1% of all publicly-posted tweets, according to the API documentation](https://dev.twitter.com/docs/streaming-api/methods#statuses-sample)), and keeps track of the links that are being passed around most right now.

## How to make it work

Create a file called `secrets.py` in the project directory:

    username = 'twitter_username'
    password = 'twitter_password'

## Lambdas!?

All right, you caught me. The real purpose of this project is to start teaching myself Python.

## Are you guys hiring?

What? Tweddit is just a little Python script. Don’t get your hopes up.

## What’s next

- Look over pruning (I've seen it crash, but not recently)
- Web interface (maybe)
- Keep state to a file so it isn’t lost when the script needs to be restarted
